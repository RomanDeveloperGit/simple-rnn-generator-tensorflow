# simple-rnn-generator-tensorflow

A simple recurrent neural network written in TensorFlow. It does not generate words, but symbolically. You give a line to enter, it gives you its continuation.

I added a version written in Python because TensorFlow Node JS is slower. In addition, more functionality is available in Python "out of the box".
